Assessment
==========

Good afternoon Leukeleu!

This is what I made in the last couple of days. 
When Dennis explained me the assignment on tuesday I was overwhelmed. Happily I watched a few Github tutorials the week before so I was at least able to begin. Fortunately I like challenges.

==========
What dit i do?  
To start off I created a virtual environment (named Marksenv) In this virtual environment I created a project (named ProjectM) In the ProjectM folder I created the polls.

to visit the backend visit : http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ (username: admin password: admin)
to visit the frontend visit: http://localhost:8000/polls/ 

==========
How it went?
The first two days I was bussy exploring how the workflow needed to be to work with Github, the methodology of Django and its language: python. When I was started to get comfortable using these unknown programs and languages I suddenly was able to build and understand the whole tutorial within time.      

Underneath a shortlist of the most annoying problems I encountered:
didn’t know how to escape the shell (keyboardinterrupt)
migration problems;
placed the poll outside the project;
understanding the shell;
the workflow for using GitHub;
etc,

All in all It gives me a good feeling that I’m able to answer the assignment.  

Have a good day!

Salute,

Mark
